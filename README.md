# Test Platform App

This project is a comprehensive test platform built using Vue, Laravel, and MySQL. The platform allows hosts to create and manage tests, send invitations, track participant progress, and monitor test sessions in real-time. The app includes features such as authentication, real-time notifications, and an anti-cheat system.

## Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Session-based Authentication:** Secure login for hosts and participants using Laravel Sanctum.
- **Access Control:** Only authenticated users can manage or participate in tests.

### Test & Session Management
- **Create Tests:** Hosts can create, edit, delete, and print tests.
- **Session Management:** Hosts can create test sessions and send invitations via email to participants.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Hosts can see who is taking the test, monitor their progress, and view results in real-time.

### Real-Time Notifications
- **Pusher Integration:** Real-time notifications for participants when they accept or decline test invitations.
- **Session Reminders:** Notifications sent 30 minutes before the start of the test session.

### Participant Tracking
- **Invitation Management:** Hosts can track how many participants accepted or declined the invitation.
- **Attempt Monitoring:** Hosts can monitor attempts for each session and see how many participants passed or failed.

### Anti-Cheat System
- **Cursor Tracking:** Detect if a participant's cursor is out of the window for more than 2 seconds. After 3 instances, the participant is flagged as having cheated.
- **Automatic Test Termination:** If the time runs out, the test is automatically terminated.

### Results & Scoring
- **Real-Time Scoring:** Monitor participantsâ€™ progress in real-time, including the number of questions answered and their scores.
- **Pass/Fail/Cheat Status:** Real-time updates on whether participants passed, failed, or cheated during the test.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue.js:** Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Laravel:** Backend framework for managing server-side logic and database operations.
- **MySQL:** Relational database for storing test data and user information.
- **Laravel Sanctum:** For session-based authentication.
- **Pusher:** For real-time notifications and updates.
- **Semantic UI:** For responsive and customizable UI components.
- **PrimeVue:** UI component library for Vue.js with a wide range of rich UI elements.
